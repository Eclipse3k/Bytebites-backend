I want to increase the security for frontend integration with the backend API to prevent unauthorized access to the API and protect sensitive data.

Make the backend API more secure by adding a new security layer to the API. This will help to prevent unauthorized access to the API and protect sensitive data.

Explain the changes and why you have done them
